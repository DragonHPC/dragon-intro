# Introduction to Dragon
Wondering where to start with Dragon? This page is for you. We'll walk through the key patterns and abstractions
and have you quickly programming at scale.

## Python multiprocessing
Dragon was initially designed to allow developers to program to the standard [Python multiprocessing API](https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html)
and scale their application to an entire supercomputer. The team took what they learned developing high-performamce, scalable software for Cray, Inc. and
apply it to the standard API for parallel Python. We won't duplicate `multiprocessing` documentation here, but it is worth reviewing some of the key interfaces
and their typical use cases.
